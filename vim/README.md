Here's the list of the necesary dependencies to properly install my Vim setup:

* Powerline
* Powerline-fonts - Careful with this, in the repos only the symbols are available. The patched fonts should be manually installed.
* fzf
* the_silver_searcher - To work in conjunction with fzf
* nodejs - for CoC
* npm - nodejs' package manager (for CoC)
